# Redirect Project

This project redirects users from the old link to a new one.

## How it works

The `index.html` file uses a meta refresh tag to automatically redirect users to `https://among-humans.onrender.com`.
If the redirection doesn't work, users can click a link to navigate to the new page manually.
